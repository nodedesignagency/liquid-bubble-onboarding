# Orbit: liquid bubble onboarding

SwiftUI onboarding (iOS 17+, no dependencies) for Orbit, a friend-circle app in the spirit of
Bump and Snapchat, told with liquid "metaball" bubbles. See README.md for the overview.

## Working with the user

- Keep working on branch `claude/nice-cori-ypokiu`: commit and push every change there.
- **End every reply that changes code with this exact command**, so the user can pull and run:

  ```sh
  cd ~/liquid-bubble-onboarding && git pull && ./scripts/run.sh
  ```

- The user runs the app in the Simulator on their Mac (Xcode 27, iOS 27.1 SDK) and sends screen
  recordings and screenshots back. Pull frames out with ffmpeg and compare closely before answering.
- `scripts/run.sh` prints only the error lines when the build fails; the full log is in
  `build/xcodebuild.log` on their machine.
- Cloud sessions have no Xcode, so SwiftUI can't be compiled here. Be careful: run `swiftc -parse`
  on every file, run the engine checks (below), and after renaming anything grep the whole project
  for the old name (a renamed scene broke the build once).
- The user cares a lot about visual quality and calls out anything that looks generic ("AI slop").
  Think it through as a designer, check the rendered preview critically, and only then show it.

## Design direction (agreed)

- Light, flat `#FAFAFA` canvas. SF Pro Rounded everywhere (`.fontDesign(.rounded)`). Bluish
  lavender liquid. The bubbles are the only color on screen.
- Top: back chevron and "Skip" in a slim row, then a centered title (30pt semibold) and one-line
  gray subtitle. Bottom: small page dots and one ink pill button ("Continue", then "Get started").
- Liquid: the reference's effect, measured on a frame of the user's reference video. Shape fitted
  to its outline at every angle (`GooLayer.softness` 10.55; the outline sits 56pt on screen from
  each photo's centre, so `haloWidth` 6.5 beyond a 45.3 photo). Edge: `edge` 0.1, about 3.4pt.
  Put through the video's own blur, our render and the reference measure and look the same at 7pt
  `edge` 0.2, but on a sharp screen a 7pt fade next to sharp photos read as haze to the user
  (twice), because in the video everything is equally soft. So edges are kept crisper than the
  video measures. A thin pale margin around each photo, scallops between neighbours, flat inside,
  no lighting. Lilac #EDDDFA, the reference's flat interior. Don't retune by eye; re-measure, and
  compare at device resolution, not only through the video blur. One pale tint per crew (lilac,
  butter, sky), blending where they meet.
- Photos: big, candid, warm (Unsplash). The reference's edge is a mask, not a blur: the photo stays
  sharp and a feathered circular mask (from 84% of the radius: 41 to 49pt on screen) turns its rim
  translucent, so the liquid shows through the edge. A longer fade read as haze. No blurred copy, no spill, nothing outside the circle (a blurred rim read as a
  drop shadow, the user's biggest complaint). No borders, no shadows, no dark vignette.
- Motion: the user now wants the reference's bounce (overshoot on arrivals and on the bloom),
  smooth elsewhere. Earlier "no bouncy springs" is superseded; still no jittery or rubbery idle.

Tried and rejected; don't bring these back: emoji avatars, studio headshots, dark mode, aurora or
mesh-gradient backgrounds, glass chips, story-style progress bars, heavy headlines with an accent
colored word, a round arrow CTA with a progress ring, a bottom-left paragraph, halos or vignettes
that read as drop shadows, gel or glass lighting on the liquid (tried in a mock, read as a drop
shadow), spread-out layouts with small photos in a big body of liquid, and copying the reference
video's layouts one to one.

The user's original reference was an Apple Photos-style "Memories" screen: clusters of photo
bubbles in soft pastel liquid with blurred photo edges. They love its liquid quality and blurred
edges, but wanted an original story, which is the current one.

## The story (one scene per page)

1. `.you` "It starts with you": one big bubble (you), outline slowly undulating.
2. `.bump` "Bump to connect": a friend drifts in from the right, collides and fuses with you
   (jelly spring), then you separate still joined by a liquid thread. Two keyframes.
3. `.circle` "Your circle grows": three friends bud out of each of you; each bud's neck stretches
   into a thread instead of snapping, making one connected liquid network.
4. `.world` "Your world, in orbit": everything drains into one drop (keyframe 1), which blooms into
   the reference's ring: nine photos (radius 45.3, at the reference's measured angles and distances,
   about 117 from the centre, overlapping a little), empty
   middle, slowly turning (keyframe 2). Earth is out of this scene for now (its dark NASA rim); the pastel globe can
   return to the middle later.
5. `.collapse` after "Get started": everything melts into Earth, which shrinks to nothing, then the
   placeholder home screen plays `.world` again.

## Code map

- `Orbit/Bubbles/BubbleEngine.swift`: pure, time-based engine. Bubbles are closed-form springs from
  their current pose to a target, so interruptions never jump; hidden bubbles ride inside their
  `anchor` bubble, which is what makes buds come out of a moving parent. Also threads (with a
  strength spring) and optional labels.
- `Orbit/Bubbles/OrbitChoreography.swift`: the layouts per scene, as keyframes, in a 372 x 480
  reference space centered on the stage. Bubble 0 is Earth, 1 you, 2 the friend you bump, 3-5
  your friends, 6-8 theirs, 9 one more for the ring.
- `Orbit/Bubbles/BubbleStage.swift`: the view. `GooLayer` draws the liquid with the `liquid` Metal
  shader (`Orbit/Bubbles/Liquid.metal`) through `.colorEffect`: discs and capsules with soft
  shoulders summed into one field, cut at 0.5 over a short ramp; the preview tool mirrors the same
  formula. Photos
  are separate views on top, layered by size (Earth just above the liquid, under everyone). The
  stage is laid out in a slot between header and footer but draws full screen.
- `Orbit/Bubbles/SpringCurve.swift`: spring presets.
- `Orbit/Components/BubbleFaces.swift`: `SoftPhoto` masks each photo once with a feathered circle;
  `AvatarFace`, `EarthFace`.
- `Orbit/Onboarding/`: copy (`OnboardingStep`), screen (`OnboardingView`), controls.
- `Orbit/Theme/Theme.swift`: colors, including the liquid's light, base, deep and shade.
- `Orbit/Assets.xcassets`: `earth`, `friend-1` (you) to `friend-9`.

SwiftUI gotchas learned on device:

- The old Canvas approach (blur, then `alphaThreshold`) is what made the liquid harsh: a hard cut
  edge, an opaque fill and painted-on highlights. Don't go back to it; the shader's threshold is a
  soft ramp computed per pixel, not a filter.
- Any view-level blur on the goo beyond ~1pt makes the rim fade out like a drop shadow.
- The shader can't be compiled in a cloud session (no Metal toolchain). Keep `Liquid.metal` simple
  and standard, and mirror any change in `tools/preview/render.py` (`shoulder`) so the preview stays
  truthful.

## Verifying without Xcode

- `swiftc -parse` each file for syntax.
- `SWIFTC=/path/to/swiftc tools/engine/run.sh` compiles the engine and choreography against a small
  SwiftUI stand-in, runs checks (scenes settle on target and fit the stage, no NaN or jumps across
  interrupted transitions, which pairs fuse at rest, thread timing versus neck release), and
  records a scripted run. On Linux, get a toolchain from download.swift.org
  (for example swift-6.1.2-RELEASE-ubuntu24.04).
- `tools/preview/run.sh` turns that recording into a motion preview video (needs python3 with
  Pillow and NumPy, ffmpeg). It approximates the real rendering (Nunito font, approximate blur),
  so it's for judging layout and motion. Keep its copy and timings in sync with
  `OnboardingStep.swift` and `tools/engine/record.swift`.

## Open items

- Waiting on the user's first Simulator recording of the "It starts with you" story; the build
  failure from the scene rename was just fixed.
- Globe: the NASA Earth photo has a dark rim and the user doesn't like it. Plan: generate a pastel
  lavender world-map texture with Magnific (uses the user's credits, so ask first) and spin it on a
  real 3D sphere (SceneKit) inside the Earth bubble. The user chose to decide this later.
- Page 1 uses a stock photo as "you"; the real app would use the user's own selfie.
